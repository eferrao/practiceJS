/* Write a program to calculate the total price of your phone purchase. You willkeep purchasing phones (hint: loop!) until you run out of money in your bankaccount. You'll also buy accessories for each phone as long as your purchaseamount is below your mental spending thresholdAfter you've calculated your purchase amount, add in the tax, then print out thecalculated purchase amount, properly formatted.Finally, check the amount against your bank account balance to see if you canafford it or not.incorporate input into this program, perhaps with the prompt(..) covered in"Input" earlier. You may prompt the user for their bank account balance */const BANK_ACCOUNT = 300const TAX_RATE = 0.08const PHONE_PRICE = 100const ACCESSORIES_PRICE = 10var totalPhones = 0; var amountSpent = 0; var halfBankAccount = BANK_ACCOUNT * 0.5; function amountWithTax(amount){	amount = ((TAX_RATE*amountSpent) + amountSpent); 	return amount;}function closeToBankAccountBalance(amount, bankAccount){	//will trigger alert when person has 20% left in their account 	var amountWTax = amountWithTax(amount); 	console.log("total amount: "+ amountWTax);	if (halfBankAccount<amountWTax){		console.log("you're total purchase is nearing your bank account balance")		console.log("your purchase will be "+ (amountWTax/bankAccount) + "% of your balance")		return true 	}	else{		return false	}}function areYouClose(){	var areYouClose = closeToBankAccountBalance(amountSpent, BANK_ACCOUNT);	console.log("areYouClose: " + areYouClose);	return areYouClose;}function buyPhones(phonePrice){	//if it is NOT near bank account balance, it will add a phone + call 	// accessory function		for (var i = 0; i < 9; i++){		if (areYouClose() == true){		console.log("you're too close")		return	}		else {		amountSpent = phonePrice+amountSpent; 		console.log("amountSpent: "+amountSpent)		totalPhones = totalPhones + 1		console.log("totalPhones: "+ totalPhones)		}	}	}function buyAccessories(accesoriesPrice, amount){	//will add accessory to amount }buyPhones(PHONE_PRICE)
